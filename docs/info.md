## How it works

This project is a really simple and easy tone-generator, more details will follow shortly.

## How to test

Details on how to test the design will follow shortly.

## External hardware

The only external hardware required will be a microcontroller of some sort that interfaces with the data-bus, as well as a low-pass-filter and an impedance-converter to create analog signals from the digital output.
